## __<font color='salmon'> Description </font>__

* In this classification problem, a Convolutional Neural Network has been developed to classify images from the CIFAR10 dataset according to the pre-set labels.

* Two different approaches have been followed; first, without applying data augmentation and second with applying data augmentation.

## __<font color='salmon'> The Data</font>__
* This project uses the CIFAR-10 dataset from pytorch (university of Toronto)
* This dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
* It has the classes: `airplane`, `automobile`, `bird`, `cat`, `deer`, `dog`, `frog`, `horse`, `ship`, `truck`.

## __<font color='salmon'> Notes</font>__
* This project was developed on google colab, using GPU.
* To reproduce this code it is suggested to use a GPU as the computational time is too high when run on CPU.
